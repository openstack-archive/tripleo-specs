==========================================
Example Spec - The title of your blueprint
==========================================

Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo

Introduction paragraph -- why are we doing anything? A single paragraph of
prose that operators can understand.

Some notes about using this template:

* Your spec should be in ReSTructured text, like this template.

* Please wrap text at 80 columns.

* The filename in the git repository should match the launchpad URL, for
  example a URL of: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/awesome-thing
  should be named awesome-thing.rst

* Please do not delete any of the sections in this template.  If you have
  nothing to say for a whole section, just write: None

* For help with syntax, see http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

* To test out your formatting, build the docs using tox, or see:
  http://rst.ninjs.org


Problem Description
===================

A detailed description of the problem:

* For a new feature this might be use cases. Ensure you are clear about the
  actors in each use case: End User vs Deployer

* For a major reworking of something existing it would describe the
  problems in that feature that are being addressed.


Proposed Change
===============

Overview
--------

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you
propose to solve this problem?

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In
other words, what's the scope of this effort?

Alternatives
------------

What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't
have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has
been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one.

Security Impact
---------------

Describe any potential security impact on the system.  Some of the items to
consider include:

* Does this change touch sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or user data?

* Does this change involve cryptography or hashing?

* Does this change require the use of sudo or any elevated privileges?

* Does this change involve using or parsing user-provided data? This could
  be directly at the API level or indirectly such as changes to a cache layer.

* Can this change enable a resource exhaustion attack, such as allowing a
  single API interaction to consume significant server resources? Some examples
  of this include launching subprocesses for each connection, or entity
  expansion attacks in XML.

For more detailed guidance, please see the OpenStack Security Guidelines as
a reference (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Guidelines).  These
guidelines are a work in progress and are designed to help you identify
security best practices.  For further information, feel free to reach out
to the OpenStack Security Group at openstack-security@lists.openstack.org.

Upgrade Impact
--------------

Describe potential upgrade impact on the system.

* Is this change meant to become the default for deployments at some
  point in the future? How do we migrate existing deployments to that
  feature?

* Can the system be upgraded to this feature using the upgrade hooks
  provided by the composable services framework?

* Describe any plans to deprecate configuration values or
  features. (For example, if we change the directory name that
  instances are stored in, how do we handle instance directories
  created before the change landed?  Do we move them?  Do we have a
  special case in the code? Do we assume that the operator will
  recreate all the instances in their cloud?)

* Please state anything that operators upgrading from the previous
  release need to be aware of. Do they need to perform extra manual
  operations?

Other End User Impact
---------------------

Are there ways a user will interact with this feature?

Performance Impact
------------------

Describe any potential performance impact on the system, for example
how often will new code be called, and is there a major change to the calling
pattern of existing code.

Examples of things to consider here include:

* A small change in a utility function or a commonly used decorator can have a
  large impacts on performance.

Other Deployer Impact
---------------------

Discuss things that will affect how you deploy and configure OpenStack
that have not already been mentioned, such as:

* What config options are being added? Should they be more generic than
  proposed (for example a flag that other hypervisor drivers might want to
  implement as well)? Are the default values ones which will work well in
  real deployments?

* Is this a change that takes immediate effect after its merged, or is it
  something that has to be explicitly enabled?

Developer Impact
----------------

Discuss things that will affect other developers working on OpenStack.


Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're
throwing it out there to see who picks it up?

If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the
primary author and contact.

Primary assignee:
  <launchpad-id or None>

Other contributors:
  <launchpad-id or None>

Work Items
----------

Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be
done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people,
but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation.


Dependencies
============

* Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in tripleo, or in other
  projects, that this one either depends on or is related to.

* If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used
  by Tripleo (such as the glance v2 API when we previously only required v1),
  document that fact.

* Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not
  included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library?


Testing
=======

Please discuss how the change will be tested.

Is this untestable in CI given current limitations (specific hardware /
software configurations available)? If so, are there mitigation plans (3rd
party testing, gate enhancements, etc).


Documentation Impact
====================

What is the impact on the docs? Don't repeat details discussed above, but
please reference them here.


References
==========

Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any
reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your
references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are:

* Links to mailing list or IRC discussions

* Links to notes from a summit session

* Links to relevant research, if appropriate

* Related specifications as appropriate (e.g.  if it's an EC2 thing, link the EC2 docs)

* Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to
